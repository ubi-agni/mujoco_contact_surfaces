# mujoco_contact_surfaces

Implementation of hydroelastic contact surfaces as a mujoco plugin. This plugin can be used with https://github.com/ubi-agni/mujoco_ros_pkgs.

```sh
# Download and extract Drake
cd <folder to install drake into>
curl -SL https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/releases/download/v1.8.0/drake-20220919-focal.tar.gz | tar -xz
export drake_DIR=$PWD/drake  # Tell cmake where to find Drake
sudo drake/share/drake/setup/install_prereqs  # Install Drake dependencies
```

## Tactile sensor simulation
This plugin can also be used to simulate tactile sensor arrays like the [Myrmex sensor](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carsten-Schuermann/publication/229035606_Modular_high_speed_tactile_sensor_system_with_video_interface/links/541affca0cf25ebee988df89/Modular-high-speed-tactile-sensor-system-with-video-interface.pdf).
